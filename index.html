                            <p>I am currently in my junior year at the University of Texas at El Paso. My major is in chemistry and I have picked this path because I hope to one day make an impact in the science field in my life time. I don’t plan on stopping my education with just a bachelor’s degree, so plan on obtaining a graduate’s degree in Chemical Engineering. My over goal with my education is help pave the path for nuclear fusion as a primary resource to power the world. I also own a software company and develop applications for mobile operating systems.

                                    <p>For my first reflection in my Rhetoric and Composition II course is the Genre Analysis paper. From the beginning of the year, our professor introduced the class to structuring, genres and the four types of writing. This paper was to help teach the students on how to deicide the type and genre to construct a well written research paper. My Genre Analysis topic paper was on Non-renewable vs. renewable resources and it was to compare two different types of genres revolving around my topic. I picked a research paper vs. a movie. Through comparing these two genres, I have learned that it very important to pick the right genre depending on the audience you want to reach out to and the message behind your paper. With my topic being heavily related to science I found out that it is best to have the information in a typography genre. The reason for this conclusion is based on how much information is needed to make a paper in a research paper. Looking back at the movie I reviewed it I miss out on a lot of information and it obviously focused on the entertainment factor verses the logic behind my genre analysis topic. There is a lot information can be place in a typography genre that is best to inform people which is needed in my topic. This assignment definitely helped me out in this course especially since my topic here is related to my Research Report for this semester which I cover in my next reflection.</p>

                                    <p>This reflection is on my Literature Review Research Report assignment for the same course, Rhetoric and Composition II. The professor gave us about 1.5 months to research a topic that effects peoples’ everyday life style. The research question or topic I picked was, which renewable resource is the most efficient for the world to invest in? A reason I picked this topic is because it is related to my major and I hope from what I learned from all this well help me educate myself to help my career in chemistry down the road. Also, It’s very exciting for me to help improve humankind in any way. An obstacle I came across this when making this paper was defining the aspect of efficiency. Efficient was hard to define in my paper because there was a lot of variables and it came to pick the ones that made the most sense for my topic. Since, my goal was to inform anybody who is interested in pushing the world to switch to renewable energy, I concluded the efficiency was based on time and money to make the change. This paper has opened my eyes to the idea that detail is key when it comes to writing. I have always been under the impression that science is easy because it’s straight forward however, it involves a lot of details. This paper also enlightened me that solar would probably be the best resources to make a fastest push to making a renewable energy the primary source. </p>

                                    <p>Another reflection is on an assignment of making a documentary based on my Literature Review Research Report. The requirements of making this video that it had to be at least four minutes long but no more than six minutes. Looking back at making this video my main issue in creating this video was the lack of education in working with video editing software or filming. I had the idea of how to word my content but how to display it was a little setback for me. To overcome this obstacle, I decided to use the I have working with computers and play around with 3 different video editing software to help me figure out the path I was going to take to displaying the information. I also was influenced to film myself through the video styles I enjoy watching when watching educational videos. This project was a great learning step for video creating and hope the of my lack skills for video production doesn’t push away from the information this is trying to convive. With that being said, the video was probably the most challenging assignment in this course. Going back to the topic of the, I would it better to just mention the finds on the resource that I concluded to be the most efficient. The summary of the video focuses on how solar energy is the most efficient resource to invest in to make renewable energy the primary source of energy. </p>

                                    <p>The last reflection for my Rhetoric and Composition II is this website! :) This e-portfolio was the most convinced assignment for me. At the beginning of this semester I told myself I was going to make a website for my resume and it has helped me improved my programming skills. I develop on the side of my college career, but I focus on iOS development so this has helped me learn another language in the computer programming world. The hardest part of this assignment was the learning curve to code my own website versus using another website to create one. There’s still a lot I would like to add to my online portfolio and hope to have more links to projects I have developed aside from my education. The e-portfolio is just a great way to create a curriculum vitae and add to it as I gain experience in other aspects. I really appreciate this assignment and understand the value of having only one curriculum vitae and a resume the next I apply for a career position. </p>

                <p>This video below is based on a project that involved researching a topic that effects everyone on a daily basis. The video is summed up version on a topic I choose to do which is, which renewable resource is the most efficient for the world to invest in? The video is based off a 10-page research paper I completed this semester for my Rhetoric and Composition II course. The goal for this research is to help the world shift from non-renewable energy to renewable energy for future generations. This task is not something that can be done overnight, therefore through my topic, helps guide us on what is the most efficient in the aspect of time and production to make renewable energy the primary source in the world. My main issue in creating this video was the lack of education in working with video editing software or filming. I had the idea of how to word my content but how to display it was a little setback for me. To overcome this obstacle, I decided to use the knowledge I have working with computers and play around with 3 different video editing software to help me figure out the path I was going to take to displaying the information.
